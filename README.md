# shotgun

A minimal screenshot utility for X11. Shotgun was written to replace
[maim](https://github.com/naelstrof/maim) in my workflow.

Features:
- Exports PNG screenshots to file or stdout
- Masks off-screen areas on multi-head setups
- Supports selections by window ID and geometry
- *On average, shotgun is more than twice as fast as maim*

## Usage

```
Usage: shotgun [options] [file]

Options:
    -i, --id ID         Window to capture
    -g, --geometry WxH+X+Y
                        Area to capture
    -h, --help          Print help and exit
```

To use with slop (as a replacement for `maim -s`):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

$sel=$(slop -f "-i %i -g %g")
shotgun $sel $*
```

## shotgun vs maim

- Only PNG is supported
- Does not attempt to wrap slop
- No cursor blending
- Properly detects that stdout is a TTY, and defaults to a time-stamped file
  instead of dumping raw PNG data into your terminal (unless `-` is specified as
  the output file name)
- Most command-line flags were omitted
- The XShape extension and `_NET_FRAME_EXTENTS` are not supported
- shotgun is written in Rust, maim in C++
- The code base is kept as small and simple as possible (as much as Rust
  permits)

There are several reasons for omitting these features:
- Features that can be replaced trivially by external programs and wrapper
  scripts:
  - Use ImageMagick's `convert` for JPEG output
  - slop output is easy to process in a shell script
  - Use `sleep` instead of `-d`, since slop has to be called separately, this
    flag is not necessary
  - `-x` shouldn't even exist in the first place, set `$DISPLAY` instead
- I never use cursor blending, and I know that most users do not actually care
  for it
- `-w` is difficult to use in scripts, rarely useful, and can be replaced by the
  calling script
- XShape is rarely used, and the proper fix for Mutter is not to use GNOME 3 in
  the first place

Please note that I do not hold anything against maim nor its author, this is
simply my rationale for writing my own replacement.

## Performance

I've claimed that shotgun is twice as fast as maim, here's some supporting
evidence:

```

./target/release/shotgun > /dev/null  0.33s user 0.01s system 111% cpu 0.303 total
```

Further profiling has shown that the bottleneck in shotgun lies fully within the
PNG encoder.
